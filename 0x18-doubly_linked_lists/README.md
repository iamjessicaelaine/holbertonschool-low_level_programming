# Project 0x18: C - Doubly Linked Lists
Responses for tasks in Project 0x18: Doubly Linked Lists in coourse PP1300 which
include code for the following functions:

/0. a function that prints all the elements of a `dlistint_t` list
1. a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `dlistint_t` list
2. a function that add a new node at the beginning of a `dlistint_t` list
3. a function that adds a new node at the end of a `dlistint_t` list
4. a function that frees a `dlistint_t` list
5. a function that returns the nth node of a `dlistint_t` linked list
6. a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `dlistint_t` linked list
7. a function that prints all the elements of a `dlistint_t` list backward
8. a function that deletes the node at `index` of a `dlistint_t` linked list

All other .c files in the directory are in support of executing or testing the above functions (for example: **0-main.c**.)
