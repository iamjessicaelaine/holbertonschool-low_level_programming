# Project 0x15. C - Bit Manipulation
Responses for tasks within Project 0x15 in Course PP1200 at Holberton School.
### Tasks include code for the following functions:
0. `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b)` - converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
1. `void print_binary(unsigned long int n)` - prints the binary representation of a number.
2. `int get_bit(unsigned long in n, unsigned int index)` - returns the value of a bit at a given index.
3. `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)` - sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
4. `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)` - sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5. `unsigned int_flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m)` - returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
## Additional Project Notes
- Header file **main.h** contains all necessary preprocessor directives for functions to func, including function prototypes and structures.
- Directory does include additional code for functions used to create the implementation of the numbered functions above (ex. *_putchar.c*).
- All *number*-main.c files included were used to test the functions (numbers in main.c name correspond to the function with the same number in it its name.
- Files name by a single letter are the executables created for function testing.
