# Project 0x16: C - File I/0
Responses for tasks within project 0x16 in Course PP1300 at Holberton School.

### Tasks include code for the following functions:
0.`ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters)` - reads a text file and prints it othe POSIX standard output.
1. `int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content)` - creates a file.
2. `int append_text_to_file(const char *filename, char *text_content)` - a function that appends text at the end of a file.

### Additional Project Notes
- **File 3-cp.c** is a program that copies the content of a file to another file.
- Header file main.h contains all necessary preprocessor directives for functions to func, including function prototypes and structures.
- Directory does include additional code for functions used to create the implementation of the numbered functions above (ex. *_putchar.c*).
- All *number*-main.c files included were used to test the functions (numbers in main.c name correspond to the function with the same number in its name).
- Files named by a single letter are the executables created for function testing.
